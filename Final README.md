## 🧠 Social Engineering Attack Types

### 1️⃣ Phishing (Email-Based)
Phishing uses **fraudulent emails** to trick users into:
- Clicking malicious links
- Downloading malware
- Sharing credentials

#### Common Indicators:

Smishing uses **fake SMS messages** containing:
- Malicious links
- Fake delivery notices
- OTP requests

📩 Example:
> "Your parcel is delayed. Click here."

## 🔍 OSINT (Open Source Intelligence – Passive & Legal)

### ✅ Google Dorking (Defensive Awareness)

Used to understand how **public data exposure** happens.

#### Common Google Dorks:
```bash
site:example.com filetype:pdf
intitle:"index of"
inurl:login
filetype:xls password
