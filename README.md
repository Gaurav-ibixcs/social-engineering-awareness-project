Ethical Social Engineering – VAPT Awareness Project
📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates Social Engineering attack techniques from a defensive and educational perspective.
The goal is to understand how attacks work so organizations and individuals can detect and prevent them.

⚠️ This project does NOT promote illegal activity.
All tools and techniques are used in controlled lab environments only.

🎯 Objectives
Understand social engineering attack vectors
Learn phishing detection methods
Perform passive OSINT (legal)
Improve user awareness & security posture
Demonstrate ethical use of SEToolkit
🧠 Social Engineering Attack Types
1️⃣ Phishing (Email-Based)
Phishing uses fraudulent emails to trick users into:

Clicking malicious links
Downloading malware
Sharing credentials
Common Indicators:
